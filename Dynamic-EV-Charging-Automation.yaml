  name: Dynamic EV Charging Automation v2.0
  description: >
    **v2.0 - Added start/stop control and fixed power calculation
    - Added charger toggle control for start/stop
    - Fixed power calculation formula
    - Added gradual adjustment to prevent charger errors
    - Improved oscillation prevention
    
    This automation dynamically adjusts the charging current of an electric vehicle (EV) based on the total power consumption in the household. 

    It ensures that the EV charger does not exceed the available power, preventing overloads and optimizing energy usage. The system continuously monitors home power consumption and regulates the charging rate accordingly. 

    You can configure two different charging periods (Day and Night) if your electricity contract has varying power limits at different times. 
  
    Depending on what you have exposed in Home Assistant you could target your car or your charger. Works with any EV charger that supports amperage control via Home Assistant. 
  domain: automation
  input:
    interval:
      name: Adjustment Interval (minutes)
      description: >
        Interval in minutes to adjust the charging amperage dynamically. 

        The automation will check the total household power consumption at this interval and adjust the EV charging current accordingly. A shorter interval (e.g., 1 minute) allows faster reactions to power fluctuations, while a longer interval (e.g., 5 minutes) reduces the number of adjustments but may respond more slowly to changes in home energy use.

        Choose the interval based on how frequently you want the system to update the charging current in response to changes in household power consumption.

    device_tracker:
      name: Car/person Location Tracker
      description: >
        Entity that determines whether the electric vehicle (EV) is at home. 

        This can be a device tracker linked to the EV, a person’s location, or any other entity that provides location-based information. 

        The automation will only adjust the charging current when the EV is detected at home, preventing unwanted changes when charging away from the configured location.

    sensor_charging:
      name: EV Charging Sensor
      description: >
        Sensor that detects whether the electric vehicle (EV) is currently charging. 

        The automation will only adjust the charging amperage if this sensor indicates that the EV is actively charging. 

        If the vehicle is at home but not plugged in or has already completed charging, no changes will be made to the charging current.

      description: >
        Select entity that controls the charging state of the EV charger.
        
        This entity should support options like "Start charging", "Stop charging", or similar commands.
        
        When the calculated amperage falls below the minimum threshold, the automation will use this entity to stop charging instead of setting amperage to 0.
        
        When power becomes available again, it will restart charging and set the appropriate amperage.

      name: Total Power Consumption Sensor
      description: Sensor that measures the total power consumption of the household in real-time.  This value is used to determine the available power for charging the electric vehicle (EV), ensuring that the charging current is dynamically adjusted to prevent exceeding the contracted power limit.

    max_grid_power_night:
      name: Maximum Grid Power during the night (W)
      description:   The maximum contracted power (in watts) available for your home during nighttime hours. This value sets the upper power limit when calculating the available energy for charging the electric vehicle (EV). If your electricity provider allows higher power usage at night, you can set a higher value here to optimize charging.

    charging_current:
      name: Charging Current Control
      description: Entity that controls the charging amperage of the electric vehicle (EV). This must be a `number` entity that allows adjusting the charging current dynamically. The automation will modify this value based on the available power in the household, ensuring efficient energy use and preventing overloads.

    max_amps:
      name: Maximum amps
      description:   Select the maximum charging current (in amps) that the electric vehicle (EV) should use. The automation will never set the charging amperage above this limit, even if there is enough available power in the household. Set this value according to the specifications of your EV charger and electrical system to ensure safe and optimal charging.

      name: Minimum amps
      description:   Select the minimum charging current (in amps) that the electric vehicle (EV) should use. If the calculated charging amperage falls below this value due to limited available power, the automation will stop charging until more power is available. This helps prevent inefficient low-power charging and ensures the EV charges only when there is sufficient energy available.

      name: Day Time Active Days
      description: Select the days of the week when the 'day_time' mode should be active. During these selected days, the automation will apply the maximum contracted power for daytime charging. If your electricity provider offers different power limits on specific days, you can configure this accordingly to optimize charging.

    day_time_start:
      name: Day Time Start Hour
      description: Choose the starting hour for 'day_time' mode. At this time, the automation will switch to the maximum contracted power for daytime charging. This is useful if your electricity provider allows higher power usage during specific hours or if you want to prioritize charging during the day. Make sure this time aligns with your electricity plan to optimize energy consumption.
