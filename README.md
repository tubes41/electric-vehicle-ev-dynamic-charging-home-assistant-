# Tesla Dynamic Charging Automation for Home Assistant (also Ford, Mercedes... any EV)

This project automates the charging current of an electric vehicle based on household power consumption.  
It works with **any EV (Tesla, Mercedes, Ford, BYD, etc.)** or **any EV charger** as long as it is integrated and can be controlled within Home Assistant.

This blueprint dynamically adjusts the charging rate, ensuring that the vehicle uses the **maximum available power** without exceeding the contracted limit.  
It also supports **different power limits for day and night** to optimize charging based on electricity tariffs.

## 🆕 **Latest Update: Version 2.0 Released!**

### ⭐ **What's New in v2.0**

**Major improvements** that make the automation more reliable and robust:

#### **Smart Start/Stop Control**
- **Automatic charger control**: Instead of trying to set charging current to 0A (which many chargers can't handle), the automation now properly stops and starts charging
- **Prevents charger errors** caused by invalid amperage values
- **Seamless operation** with intelligent state management

#### **Fixed Power Calculation Logic**
- Resolved critical issues in power calculation that could cause incorrect decisions
- **No more oscillating** start/stop behavior
- **Accurate power management** ensures optimal charging

#### **Enhanced Stability**
- **Gradual amperage adjustment** prevents rapid changes that cause charger errors
- **Improved reliability** during power fluctuations
- **Better error handling** for edge cases

### 🔄 **Important for Existing Users**
**You MUST recreate your automation** as new configuration options have been added. The new version requires a `select` entity to control charger start/stop functionality.

## 🔌 🚗 🔋 Tested Hardware  

This is some of the hardware I've used and tested with this automation:  

- [Shelly EM Energy Meter](https://amzlink.to/az0UFbhU9htEu)  
- Tesla car with [Tesla Fleet integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tesla_fleet/).  
  - [Buy your Tesla with a discount through this link](https://ts.la/eduardo432919)  
- [Feyree Type 2 portable 7kW charger](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_opguDAp)  
- [Feyree Type 2 Wallbox](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oEFZ75f)  

Just to be clear, if you can control your car from Home Assistant and have access to its sensors, you can use this automation without a connected charger. But by controlling the charger you make sure future compatibility (and be able to charge different cars)

## 🔧 Requirements

Before using this blueprint, you need the following:

- **Total Power Consumption Sensor** (e.g., <a href="https://amzlink.to/az0UFbhU9htEu" target=_blank>Shelly EM Gen3</a> is recommended if you don't have one. You can get it from that link).
- **Your EV or Charger integrated into Home Assistant**, exposing the necessary sensors. I use this <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_opguDAp" target=_blank>Feyree portable charger</a>, I haven't tested with any other.
- **Basic information about your electricity contract**, including:
  - Grid voltage (e.g., 230V for EU, 120V for the US).
  - Maximum grid power limits (contracted power).
  - Day and night tariff periods (if applicable).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The following parameters need to be configured:

### **Basic Settings**
- **Charging interval** (1, 3, or 5 minutes).
- **A device tracker** (preferably the car) to ensure that the automation runs only when the EV is at home.
- **A charging status sensor** to ensure changes are only made when the EV is actively charging.
- **Total power consumption sensor** (measured in watts).

### **Power Management**
- **Maximum Grid Power (Day)** – Set to **0** if you only want to charge at night.
- **Maximum Grid Power (Night)**.
- **Grid voltage**.
- **Maximum charging amperage** – The system will never exceed this limit, even if extra power is available.
- **Minimum charging amperage** – The system will stop charging if power availability drops below this threshold.

### **Charger Control (New in v2.0)**
- **Charging current control entity** – The EV or charger must support dynamic amperage control.
- **🆕 EV Charging Toggle (Start/Stop)** – A `select` entity that controls your charger's start/stop state with options like:
  - `"Start charging"`
  - `"Stop charging"`
  - `"Waiting for command"`

### **Time Periods**
- **Day-time period settings** (Define when "day" mode applies, typically when electricity is more expensive or power is limited).

## 🚀 How It Works

The automation runs every **1, 3, or 5 minutes**, depending on the selected interval.  
It **only** adjusts the charging rate if the EV is **charging** and **at home**.  

### **Intelligent Power Management (v2.0)**
1. **Monitors** total household power consumption
2. **Calculates** available power for EV charging
3. **Adjusts** charging current gradually (1A steps with delays)
4. **Stops charging** when insufficient power (instead of attempting invalid 0A)
5. **Restarts automatically** when power becomes available

### **Dynamic Load Adjustment**
The automation continuously monitors household power usage and dynamically **adjusts the charging current** to avoid exceeding the contracted power limit.  
If a high-power appliance (e.g., oven, stove, heating) is turned on, the charging rate will **automatically decrease** to prevent overloading.  
Once power consumption drops, the EV will **resume charging at the maximum allowed rate**.

### **Day & Night Power Limits**
Many electricity contracts offer **cheaper power at night**, along with **higher power limits**.  
This blueprint allows setting **different power limits for day and night**, ensuring that charging is optimized based on your tariff structure.

### **Safety Features**
- **Maximum/minimum amperage limits**
- **Gradual adjustments** to prevent charger errors
- **Only operates** when car is home and plugged in
- **Respects charger capabilities**

## 🔍 **Compatibility**

**Works with any EV charger that has:**

- ✅ Amperage control via Home Assistant (`number` entity)
- ✅ Start/stop control via Home Assistant (`select` entity) 
- ✅ Charging state sensor (`sensor` entity)

---

## 💡 **Tips for Best Results**

1. **Set realistic min/max amperage** based on your electrical system
2. **Monitor for the first few days** to ensure stable operation
3. **Adjust time periods** to match your electricity tariff
4. **Use shorter intervals** (1 min) for faster response to power changes
